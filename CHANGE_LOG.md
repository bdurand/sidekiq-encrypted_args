## 1.1.1

## 1.1.0

### Added

- Use `to_json` if it is defined when serializing encrypted args to JSON.
- Add client middleware to the server default configuration. This ensures that arguments will be encrypted if a worker enqueues a job with encrypted arguments.
- Client middleware now reads sidekiq options from the job hash instead of from the worker class so that the list of encrypted arguments is always in sync on the job payload.
- Added additional option to specify encrypted args with array of argument indexes.

### Changed

- Client middleware is now prepended while server middleware is appended.

### Fixed

- Don't raise error if undefined class name is passed to client middleware as a string.
